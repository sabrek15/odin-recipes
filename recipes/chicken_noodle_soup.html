            <h3>Procedure</h3>
            <li>In the first step of this chicken soup recipe, diced onions and chopped celery are cooked in butter
                until they're aromatic and tender</li>
            <li>This chicken noodle soup recipe calls for a mixture of chicken and vegetable broths. If you're short on
                time or ingredients, you can just use one or the other.</li>
            <li>Of course, you'll need chicken. If you have leftover rotisserie chicken, you can use that in place of
                the cooked chicken breasts for a budget-friendly shortcut.</li>
            <li>Make sure you don't add the noodles to early, as cooking them too long will make them mushy.</li>
            <li>Carrots, which add a pop of bright color and flavour, are added at the end of cooking so they stay
                crisp. You can add them to the sauteed vegetables at the beginning if you like your carrots tender</li>
            <li>Dried basil and oregano lend warm, earthy flavor to this chicken noodle soup recipe</li>
        </ol>
